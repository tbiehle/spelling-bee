# spelling-bee
A simple solver for the New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle.

I've been playing the spelling bee a lot recently and decided to make a solver.

To use the code, download the words.txt file and make sure the first few lines of code call the file properly. 

You can use this code if you want, but please don't distribute it for personal gain or take credit for it. Have fun solving!
